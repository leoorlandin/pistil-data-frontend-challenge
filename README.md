## About This Project

This project is a challenge proposed by the company Pistil Data to apply for a position as a frontend developer.

The application consists of a web page that loads a list of products with their respective characteristics. It is also possible to filter these products by: strain, strain type and brand.

After that run:

1. Run `yarn` to install the dependecies;
2. Run `yarn start` to run projecto (it will be running on port 1922).

### With the server running, perform the following steps

To see the application you can check the first link above, but if you want, you can also run it locally by following the steps:
1. Run `yarn` to install the dependecies;
2. Run `yarn start` to run projecto (it will be running on port 3000).
